# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep CrashpadKiller secure. This project follows a "best-effort" community security process: we will do our best to investigate and remediate reported vulnerabilities in a timely manner, but we cannot guarantee response times or support levels.

## Report a vulnerability (private disclosure)

Please do NOT open a public issue or PR to report a security vulnerability. Instead, report it privately using GitHub's security reporting flow for this repository:

- Report privately via GitHub: https://github.com/hsaito/CrashpadKiller/security/report

If you are unable to reach us using the repository security form, use GitHub's general vulnerability reporting guidance: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/reporting-a-vulnerability-to-github or the GitHub report form: https://github.com/contact/report-a-vulnerability

## What to include in your report

To help us triage and fix issues quickly, please include as much of the following as possible:

- Affected version(s) or commit(s)
- A clear description of the issue and its impact
- Reproduction steps and/or a proof-of-concept (PoC) if possible
- Any attack surface or mitigation advice
- Whether you want to be credited and how to contact you (or indicate if you prefer to remain anonymous)

If you need confidentiality, state it explicitly in your report.

## Response & disclosure

We aim to acknowledge reports as soon as possible (typically within 7 days) and will coordinate with the reporter to validate and fix issues. We follow coordinated disclosure practices and will generally aim to fix confirmed vulnerabilities before public disclosure.

Because this is a community-maintained project, timelines are best-effort and may vary depending on maintainer availability.

## If you accidentally disclose publicly

If a vulnerability is accidentally disclosed in a public issue or PR, please remove sensitive information immediately and report it privately using the links above.
